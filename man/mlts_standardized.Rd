\usage{
mlts_standardized(
  object,
  what = c("between", "within", "both"),
  digits = 3,
  prob = 0.95,
  add_cluster_std = FALSE,
  get_samples = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{mltsfit}. Output of \code{\link[mlts]{mlts_model}} and related functions.}

\item{what}{character. Get between-level standardized estimates (\code{what = "between"}, the default),
within-level standardized estimates averaged over clusters (\code{what = "within"}), or both (\code{what = "both"}).}

\item{digits}{Number of digits. Default is 3.}

\item{prob}{A value between 0 and 1 to indicate the width of the credible
interval. Default is .95.}

\item{add_cluster_std}{logical. If \code{what = "within"}, within-level standardized effects for each cluster
are included in the output (defaults to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{get_samples}{logical. For internal use.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing between- and within-level standardized parameters.
