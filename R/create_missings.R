#' Create Missings for Approximation of Continuous Time Dynamic Models
#'
#' @param data An object of class `data.frame` (or one that can be coerced
#' to that class) containing data of all variables used in the model.
#' @param tinterval The step interval for approximation for a continuous time DSEM.
#' The smaller the step interval, the better the approximation.
#' @param id The variable in `data` that identifies the person or observational
#' unit (as character).
#' @param time The variable in `data` that contains the (continuous) time (as
#' string).
#' @param btw_vars The names of between-level variables in the data to be
#' added in newly created rows with NAs.
#'
#' @return A `data.frame` with missings imputed for use in \code{\link{mlts_fit}}.
